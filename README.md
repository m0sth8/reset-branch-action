## Reset a Neon Branch ðŸš€
This GitHub action resets a child branch with the latest data from its parent branch. Future releases will support other types of branch resets. For example, rewind a branch to an earlier point in time.

Here is an example of how to use it:

```yml
name: Reset Neon Branch with GitHub Actions Demo
run-name: Reset a Neon Branch ðŸš€
jobs:
  Reset-Neon-Branch:
    steps:
      - uses: neondatabase/reset-branch-action@v1
        with:
          project_id: rapid-haze-373089
          parent: true
          branch: child_branch
          api_key: ${{ secrets.NEON_API_KEY }}
        id: reset-branch
      - run: echo branch_id ${{ steps.reset-branch.outputs.branch_id }}
```
### Input variables

- `project_id`: The ID of your Neon project. Find this value in the Neon Console on the **Settings** page.
- `parent`: If specified, the branch will be reset to the latest (HEAD) of parent branch.
- `branch`: The name or id of the branch to reset.
- `api_key`: An API key created in your Neon account. See [How to set up the NEON_API_KEY](#how-to-set-up-the-neon_api_key) for instructions. 
The action provides connection string as an output. `cs_*` optional inputs allow connection string to be configured. 
- `cs_role_name`: The output connection string db role name.
- `cs_database`: The output connection string database name.
- `cs_prisma`: Use prisma in output connection string or not. Default - 'false'. 
- `cs_ssl`: Add sslmode to the connection string. Supported values are: "require", "verify-ca", "verify-full", "omit".  Default - 'require'.

### Outputs

```yaml
outputs:
  branch_id:
    description: 'Reset branch id'
    value: ${{ steps.reset-branch.outputs.branch_id }}
  db_url:
    description: 'DATABASE_URL of the branch after the reset'
    value: ${{ steps.reset-branch.outputs.db_url }}
  db_url_with_pooler:
    description: 'DATABASE_URL with pooler of the branch after the reset'
    value: ${{ steps.reset-branch.outputs.db_url_with_pooler }}
  host:
    description: 'Branch host after reset'
    value: ${{ steps.reset-branch.outputs.host }}
  host_with_pooler:
    description: 'Branch host with pooling enabled after reset'
    value: ${{ steps.reset-branch.outputs.host_with_pooler }}
  password:

    value: ${{ steps.reset-branch.outputs.password }}
```
- `branch_id`: The ID of the newly reset branch.
- `db_url`: Database connection string to the branch after the reset.
- `db_url_with_pooler`: Database pooled connection string to the branch after the reset.
- `host`: Branch host after reset.
- `host_with_pooler`: Branch host with pooling enabled after reset.
- `password`: Password for connecting to the new branch database with the input username after reset.

## How to set up the NEON_API_KEY
Navigate to the [Developer Settings](https://console.neon.tech/app/settings/api-keys) page in the Neon Console. Generate a new API key if you don't have one already. It's important not to share the API key or expose it in your actions or code. This is why you need to add the API key to a new GitHub secret.

In your GitHub repo, go to `Settings` and locate `Secrets` at the bottom of the left sidebar. Click on `Actions` and then on the `New repository secret` button to create a new secret.
Name the secret `NEON_API_KEY` and paste the API key generated on the Neon console in the `Secret*` field, then press `Add secret` button.

See full documentation about managing API keys [here](https://neon.tech/docs/manage/api-keys).
